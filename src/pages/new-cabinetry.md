## New Cabinetry
##### Frameless or Traditional
When choosing to install all new cabinetry Mtn Kitchens offers a variety of Showplace Wood Products to select from:

#### Frameless (Evo Line)
The new Evo line from Showplace. The name is a play on “evolution” and represents a more modern look for cabinetry called full access or frameless.

“The new line is four pieces of material joined together without a hardwood face frame, so there’s marginal increase in capacity, but it lends itself to a more contemporary and modern look,” said Scott Korsten, director of marketing at Showplace Wood Products.

#### Traditional
Most furniture and cabinets use what is called "overlay" construction: Doors and drawer headers are in front of the cabinet's face frame, and are slightly larger than the openings in the frame, so they overlap or "overlay" them.
