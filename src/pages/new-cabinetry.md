#### **New Cabinetry**
#### **Frameless (Evo Line)**
##### The new Evo Line from Showplace represents a more modern look for cabinetry called full access or frameless. It is four pieces of material joined together without a hardwood face frame, so there’s marginal increase in capacity, but it lends itself to a more contemporary and modern look,” said Scott Korsten, director of marketing at Showplace Wood Products.




#### **Traditional**
##### Most furniture and cabinets use what is called "overlay" construction: Doors and drawer headers are in front of the cabinet's face frame, and are slightly larger than the openings in the frame, so they overlap or "overlay" them.
