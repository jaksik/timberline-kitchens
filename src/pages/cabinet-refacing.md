#### **Cabinet Refacing / Rebuilding**
#### Save time and money by not replacing your perfectly good cabinets
#### Refacing your existing cabinets is not only affordable but the most effective use of your remodeling budget. Transform your kitchen or bath for about 40% the cost and 25-50% of the time of a full remodel. We can reface and entire kitchens and bathrooms, install new drawer boxes with Blum soft-close Glides, fix damaged sink bases from water damage, all on site without removing your countertops. Doors and drawer headers are removed and replaced, exposed frames and ends are resurfaced with hardwood veneer, new moldings, trims, accents and accessories. The finished effect is an astounding kitchen or bath with a fresh new look. Refacing is almost half the cost of new cabinets and can be done in just a few days without removing contents or unnecessary mess.

#### **Customization**
#### Love the blueprint of your existing cabinets but want to add more? We are able to add new cabinets and reface existing cabinets to match. Maybe you would like to add glass uppers for reveal or LED lighting inside or underneath your cabinets. Any ideas or creativity you come up with is not a problem and we are happy to help. Shop Kitchen idea books, neighbor's configurations or magazines. Sometimes we can't always duplicate but with a little imagination we can obtain an equal or better result.
