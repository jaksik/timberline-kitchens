#### **New Cabinet Installation**
##### FOCO Cabinets is a Showplace Cabinetry certified retailer. Showplace is one of the leading cabinet manufacturers in the United States and have been building the highest quality customized cabinets since 1999. After we get to know your project and what your dream cabinets would look like, we get to work using the latest software to create a 3D mockup of the finished product. When your satisfied we order your custom cabinets and can be installing them in your house in as little as 2 weeks.

#### **Frameless (Evo Line)**
##### The new Evo Line from Showplace represents a more modern look for cabinetry called full access or frameless. It is four pieces of material joined together without a hardwood face frame, so there’s marginal increase in capacity, but it lends itself to a more contemporary and modern look,” said Scott Korsten, director of marketing at Showplace Wood Products.

#### **Traditional**
##### Most furniture and cabinets use what is called "overlay" construction: Doors and drawer headers are in front of the cabinet's face frame, and are slightly larger than the openings in the frame, so they overlap or "overlay" them.

#### **More Than Just Cabinets**
##### FOCO Cabinets knows that when you are looking to get new cabinets, you're probably looking to make other upgrades as well, such as counter tops and flooring. We are happy to manage your entire project, take away the hastle, and contract out the other parts of your project.
